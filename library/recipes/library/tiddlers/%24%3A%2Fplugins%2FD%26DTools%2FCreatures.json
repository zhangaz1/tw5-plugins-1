If the behir dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone.\",\n            \"cha\": \"12\",\n            \"challenge_rating\": \"11\",\n            \"con\": \"18\",\n            \"condition_immunities\": \"\",\n            \"created\": \"20181223151326819\",\n            \"creature_type\": \"monstrosity\",\n            \"damage_immunities\": \"lightning\",\n            \"damage_resistances\": \"\",\n            \"dex\": \"16\",\n            \"features\": \"\",\n            \"hp\": \"168\",\n            \"hp_generation\": \"16d12+64\",\n            \"int\": \"7\",\n            \"languages\": \"Draconic\",\n            \"modified\": \"20181223151326819\",\n            \"saving_throws\": \"\",\n            \"senses\": \"Darkvision 90 ft., PP 16\",\n            \"size\": \"Huge\",\n            \"skills\": \"Perception +6, Stealth +7\",\n            \"speed\": \"50 ft., climb 40 ft.\",\n            \"str\": \"23\",\n            \"type\": \"Creature\",\n            \"wis\": \"14\",\n            \"xp\": \"7200\",\n            \"text\": \"\"\n        },\n        \"Berserker\": {\n            \"title\": \"Berserker\",\n            \"ac\": \"13\",\n            \"ac_description\": \"hide armor\",\n            \"alignment\": \"any chaotic alignment\",\n            \"attacks\": \"<i><b>Greataxe:</b> Melee Weapon Attack:</i> +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <i>Hit:</i> 9 (1d12+3) slashing damage.\",\n            \"cha\": \"9\",\n            \"challenge_rating\": \"2\",\n            \"con\": \"17\",\n            \"condition_immunities\": \"\",\n            \"created\": \"20181223151507313\",\n            \"creature_type\": \"humanoid\",\n            \"damage_immunities\": \"\",\n            \"damage_resistances\": \"\",\n            \"dex\": \"12\",\n            \"features\": \"<i><b>Reckless:</b></i> At the start of its turn, the berserker can gain advantage on all melee weapon attack rolls during that turn, but attack rolls against it have advantage until the start of its next turn.\",\n            \"hp\": \"67\",\n            \"hp_generation\": \"9d8+27\",\n            \"int\": \"9\",\n            \"languages\": \"any one language (usually Common)\",\n            \"modified\": \"20181223151507313\",\n            \"saving_throws\": \"\",\n            \"senses\": \"PP 10\",\n            \"size\": \"Medium\",\n            \"skills\": \"\",\n            \"speed\": \"30 ft.\",\n            \"str\": \"16\",\n            \"subtype\": \"any race\",\n            \"type\": \"Creature\",\n            \"wis\": \"11\",\n            \"xp\": \"450\",\n            \"text\": \"\"\n        },\n        \"Black Bear\": {\n            \"title\": \"Black Bear\",\n            \"ac\": \"11\",\n            \"ac_description\": \"natural armor\",\n            \"alignment\": \"unaligned\",\n            \"attacks\": \"<i><b>Multiattack:</b></i> The bear makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws.<br><br><i><b>Bite:</b> Melee Weapon Attack:</i> +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <i>Hit:</i> 5 (1d6+2) piercing damage.<br><br><i><b>Claws:</b> Melee Weapon Attack:</i> +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <i>Hit:</i> 7 (2d4+2) slashing damage.\",\n            \"cha\": \"7\",\n            \"challenge_rating\": \"1/2\",\n            \"con\": \"14\",\n            \"condition_immunities\": \"\",\n            \"created\": \"20181223151326819\",\n            \"creature_type\": \"beast\",\n            \"damage_immunities\": \"\",\n            \"damage_resistances\": \"\",\n            \"dex\": \"10\",\n            \"features\": \"<i><b>Keen Smell:</b></i> The bear has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.\",\n            \"hp\": \"19\",\n            \"hp_generation\": \"3d8+6\",\n            \"int\": \"2\",\n            \"languages\": \"---\",\n            \"modified\": \"20181223151326819\",\n            \"saving_throws\": \"\",\n            \"senses\": \"PP 13\",\n            \"size\": \"Medium\",\n            \"skills\": \"Perception +3\",\n            \"speed\": \"40 ft., climb 30 ft.\",\n            \"str\": \"15\",\n            \"type\": \"Creature\",\n            \"wis\": \"12\",\n            \"xp\": \"100\",\n            \"text\": \"\"\n        },\n        \"Black Dragon Wyrmling\": {\n            \"title\": \"Black Dragon Wyrmling\",\n            \"ac\": \"17\",\n            \"ac_description\": \"natural armor\",\n            \"alignment\": \"chaotic evil\",\n            \"attacks\": \"<i><b>Bite:</b> Melee Weapon Attack:</i> +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <i>Hit:</i> 7 (1d10+2) piercing damage plus 2 (1d4) acid damage.<br><br><i><b>Acid Breath (Recharge 5-6):</b></i> The dragon exhales acid in a 15-foot line that is 5 feet wide.

Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the tarrasque can't bite another target.<br><br><i><b>Claw:</b> Melee Weapon Attack:</i> +19 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. <i>Hit:</i> 28 (4d8+10) stashing damage.<br><br><i><b>Horns:</b> Melee Weapon Attack:</i> +19 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <i>Hit:</i> 32 (4d10+10) piercing damage.<br><br><i><b>Tail:</b> Melee Weapon Attack:</i> +19 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. <i>Hit:</i> 24 (4d6+10) bludgeoning damage.

A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the tarrasque is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw Is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the tarrasque's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.<br /><i><b>Swallow:</b></i> The tarrasque makes one bite attack against a Large or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target takes the bite's damage, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the tarrasque, and it takes bO (I6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the tarrasque's turns. If the tarrasque takes 60 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the tarrasque must succeed on a DC 30 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the tarrasque. If the tarrasque dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 30 feet of movement, exiting prone.<br><br>\",\n            \"cha\": \"11\",\n            \"challenge_rating\": \"30\",\n            \"con\": \"30\",\n            \"condition_immunities\": \"charmed, frightened, paralyzed, poisoned\",\n            \"created\": \"20181216155415878\",\n            \"creature_type\": \"monstrosity\",\n            \"damage_immunities\": \"fire, poison, bludgeoning, piercing and slashing from nonmagical attacks\",\n            \"damage_resistances\": \"\",\n            \"dex\": \"11\",\n            \"features\": \"<i><b>Legendary Resistance (3/Day):</b></i> If the tarrasque fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.<br><br><i><b>Magic Resistance:</b></i> The tarrasque has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.<br><br><i><b>Reflective Carapace:</b></i> Any time the tarrasque is targeted by a magic missile spell, a line spell, or a spell that requires a ranged attack roll, roll a d6.
