While swallowed, the target is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the behir, and it takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the behir's turns. A behir can have only one creature swallowed at a time.<br>If the behir takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed creature, the behir must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls prone in a space within 10 feet of the behir. If the behir dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone.\",\n            \"cha\": \"12\",\n            \"challenge_rating\": \"11\",\n            \"con\": \"18\",\n            \"condition_immunities\": \"\",\n            \"created\": \"20181223151326819\",\n            \"creature_type\": \"monstrosity\",\n            \"damage_immunities\": \"lightning\",\n            \"damage_resistances\": \"\",\n            \"dex\": \"16\",\n            \"features\": \"\",\n            \"hp\": \"168\",\n            \"hp_generation\": \"16d12+64\",\n            \"int\": \"7\",\n            \"languages\": \"Draconic\",\n            \"modified\": \"20181223151326819\",\n            \"saving_throws\": \"\",\n            \"senses\": \"Darkvision 90 ft., PP 16\",\n            \"size\": \"Huge\",\n            \"skills\": \"Perception +6, Stealth +7\",\n            \"speed\": \"50 ft., climb 40 ft.\",\n            \"str\": \"23\",\n            \"type\": \"Creature\",\n            \"wis\": \"14\",\n            \"xp\": \"7200\",\n            \"text\": \"\"\n        },\n        \"Berserker\": {\n            \"title\": \"Berserker\",\n            \"=\\\"\\\"\": \"\",\n            \"ac\": \"13\",\n            \"ac_description\": \"hide armor\",\n            \"alignment\": \"any chaotic alignment\",\n            \"attacks\": \"<i><b>Greataxe:</b> Melee Weapon Attack:</i> +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <i>Hit:</i> 9 (1d12+3) slashing damage.\",\n            \"cha\": \"9\",\n            \"challenge_rating\": \"2\",\n            \"con\": \"17\",\n            \"condition_immunities\": \"\",\n            \"created\": \"20181223151507313\",\n            \"creature_type\": \"humanoid\",\n            \"damage_immunities\": \"\",\n            \"damage_resistances\": \"\",\n            \"dex\": \"12\",\n            \"features\": \"<i><b>Reckless:</b></i> At the start of its turn, the berserker can gain advantage on all melee weapon attack rolls during that turn, but attack rolls against it have advantage until the start of its next turn.\",\n            \"hp\": \"67\",\n            \"hp_generation\": \"9d8+27\",\n            \"int\": \"9\",\n            \"languages\": \"any one language (usually Common)\",\n            \"modified\": \"20181223151507313\",\n            \"saving_throws\": \"\",\n            \"senses\": \"PP 10\",\n            \"size\": \"Medium\",\n            \"skills\": \"\",\n            \"speed\": \"30 ft.\",\n            \"str\": \"16\",\n            \"subtype\": \"any race\",\n            \"type\": \"Creature\",\n            \"wis\": \"11\",\n            \"xp\": \"450\",\n            \"text\": \"\"\n        },\n        \"Black Bear\": {\n            \"title\": \"Black Bear\",\n            \"=\\\"\\\"\": \"\",\n            \"ac\": \"11\",\n            \"ac_description\": \"natural armor\",\n            \"alignment\": \"unaligned\",\n            \"attacks\": \"<i><b>Multiattack:</b></i> The bear makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws.<br><br><i><b>Bite:</b> Melee Weapon Attack:</i> +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <i>Hit:</i> 5 (1d6+2) piercing damage.<br><br><i><b>Claws:</b> Melee Weapon Attack:</i> +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <i>Hit:</i> 7 (2d4+2) slashing damage.\",\n            \"cha\": \"7\",\n            \"challenge_rating\": \"1/2\",\n            \"con\": \"14\",\n            \"condition_immunities\": \"\",\n            \"created\": \"20181223151326819\",\n            \"creature_type\": \"beast\",\n            \"damage_immunities\": \"\",\n            \"damage_resistances\": \"\",\n            \"dex\": \"10\",\n            \"features\": \"<i><b>Keen Smell:</b></i> The bear has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.\",\n            \"hp\": \"19\",\n            \"hp_generation\": \"3d8+6\",\n            \"int\": \"2\",\n            \"languages\": \"---\",\n            \"modified\": \"20181223151326819\",\n            \"saving_throws\": \"\",\n            \"senses\": \"PP 13\",\n            \"size\": \"Medium\",\n            \"skills\": \"Perception +3\",\n            \"speed\": \"40 ft., climb 30 ft.\",\n            \"str\": \"15\",\n            \"type\": \"Creature\",\n            \"wis\": \"12\",\n            \"xp\": \"100\",\n            \"text\": \"\"\n        },\n        \"Black Dragon Wyrmling\": {\n            \"title\": \"Black Dragon Wyrmling\",\n            \"=\\\"\\\"\": \"\",\n            \"ac\": \"17\",\n            \"ac_description\": \"natural armor\",\n            \"alignment\": \"chaotic evil\",\n            \"attacks\": \"<i><b>Bite:</b> Melee Weapon Attack:</i> +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <i>Hit:</i> 7 (1d10+2) piercing damage plus 2 (1d4) acid damage.<br><br><i><b>Acid Breath (Recharge 5-6):</b></i> The dragon exhales acid in a 15-foot line that is 5 feet wide.
